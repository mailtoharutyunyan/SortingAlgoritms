/*
 A simple approach is to do linear LinearSearch, i.e

Start from the leftmost element of arr[] and one by one compare x with each element of arr[]
If x matches with an element, return the index.
If x doesnâ€™t match with any of elements, return -1.

The time complexity of above algorithm is O(n).
Linear LinearSearch is rarely used practically because other LinearSearch algorithms 
such as the binary LinearSearch algorithm and hash tables allow significantly 
faster searching comparison to Linear LinearSearch.
